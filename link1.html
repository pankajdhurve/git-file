<p> Though colonized by the Great Britain Empire for almost 200 years, the Indians never gave up their hope for liberty. During 1857 and 1858, the Indians rose against the rule of British East India Company. The Indian Rebellion of 1857 was ultimately unsuccessful, but it still proved to be an important watershed in the history of Indian-British relations and marked the beginning of the Indian Independence Movement. Then did the Non-Cooperation Movement come in 1920 and Mahatma Gandhi rose as one of the most important contributors to India’s decolonization. In 1942, Gandhi led the Quit India Campaign, a mass protest demanding "An Orderly British Withdrawal" from India. </p>

Gandhi’s famous 'Dear Friend' letters to Hitler were also written during this time. In 1947, Indians finally saw their independence from the British and long-awaited self-governing India legally came into existence. </p>
